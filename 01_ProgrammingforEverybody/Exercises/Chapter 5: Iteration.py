# Exercise 1: Write a program which repeatedly reads numbers until the user enters “done”. Once “done” is entered, print out the total, count, and average of the numbers. 
# If the user enters anything other than a number, detect their mistake using try and except and print an error message and skip to the next number.

num = 0
tot =0.0
while True :
    sval = input('Enter a number: ')
    if sval == 'done":
        break
    try:
        fval = float(sval)
    except:
        print('Invalid input')
        continue
  
    # print (fval)
    num = num + 1
    tot = tot + fval
    
print(tot, num, tot/num)
